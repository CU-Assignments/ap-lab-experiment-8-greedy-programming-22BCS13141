## Greedy Programming
Greedy programming is a problem-solving approach where an algorithm makes the locally optimal choice at each step, aiming to find the global optimum. At every stage, it picks the option that appears to provide the most immediate benefit, without reconsidering previous decisions. Greedy algorithms are simple, fast, and often easy to implement, but they do not always guarantee an optimal solution for every problem. https://learnloner.com/the-greedy-algorithm/

Greedy algorithms are algorithms that take the best, immediate, or local, solution while looking for an answer. They identify the globally (overall)  optimal solution for certain optimization problems but might identify less-than-optimal solutions for certain instances of other problems. It follows the problem-solving heuristic of making the locally optimal choice at every stage.
They are known as greedy algorithms because even though finding an optimal solution for every smaller instance will give you an instant output, the algorithm does not take the larger problem into account. It never reconsiders any decisions after they are made. 
### There are two conditions that define the greedy paradigm:
1. Every stepwise solution needs to structure a problem towards its best-accepted solution.
2. It is sufficient if the structuring of the problem could stop in a finite number of greedy steps.
